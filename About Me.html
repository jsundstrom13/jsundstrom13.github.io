    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p1> Currently I'm in my junior year here at URI. I'm from Warwick, Rhode Island and I commute so a class that I don't have to <br>
     leave my house for (or change out of my pajamas) is a big plus. In my free time I like to write or play music with my friends; <br>
      I play out sometimes at restaurant gigs in a jazz trio where I play the drums. I'm also learning the piano and I <br> 
      compose music either on the computer or by hand. I also love to eat, so naturally I spned a lot of time cooking. <br>
      At URI, I'm a biotechnology major but I've become more interested in computing and programming the more I learn about it. <br>
      This is my first computing class, but if it fits me I'm considering a minor in computer science. <br>
      I'm looking forward to the semester and finding out what programming has to offer! </p1>
