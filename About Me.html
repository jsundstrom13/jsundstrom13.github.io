    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p1> Currently I'm in my junior year here at URI. I'm from Warwick, Rhode Island and I commute so a class that I don't have to <br>
     leave my house for (or change out of my pajamas) is a big plus. I'm a biotechnology major but I've become more interested in <br>
    computing and programming the more I learn about it. This is my first computing class, but if it fits me I'm considering a minor <br> or 
    possibly a double major in computer science. I'm looking forward to the semester and finding out what programming has to offer! </p1>
