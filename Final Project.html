    <h1> Final Project</h1>
    <p1>This webpage is dedicated to my final project content for CSC 106. I chose to create a game, called "Pizza Delivery." 
    The premise of the game is simple: deliver the pizza. The characers within the game are heavily based on my own experience as a
    delivery driver. The game instructions are explained within the game itself, but they are breifly as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> There are two levels, Cross the screen to complete each level and get a tip.
      <li> The character moves across the screen automatically, but you control up / down movement
      <li> The enemies are from a rival restaurant called YBL and want to steal your recipes
      <li> Click to shoot them or avoid them with the up and down arrow keys 
      <li> If they touch you, you stop moving for 3 seconds
      <li> If they reach the left side of the screen, they steal a recipe
      <li> Your recipes are your health
      <li> If they reach 0, the game ends
      <li> Your tips are your score
      <li> Tips are calcuated based on how many recipes you have left when you reach the right side 
      and how long it took you to get there
    </ul>
    Good luck!
